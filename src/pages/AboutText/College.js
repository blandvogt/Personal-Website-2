      For college I attended Long Island University's Honor Program (LIU) 
      on a half academic scholarship. I majored in Computer Science, with 
      minors in Business Administration and Information Systems Management. 
      My graduation was one semester early and I finished in the top 10% of 
      the class with a Bachelor of Science with Honors and a 3.7 GPA (out of 4.0).
