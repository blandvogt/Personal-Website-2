      I think my Dad wanted me and my two younger brothers to be rock stars. Not one of the 
      super famous bands that died at the ages of 40. More like one of those regional bands 
      that he could brag about to his friends, but that would disappear into oblivion after 
      a couple years. Nonetheless, I took professional guitar lessons for about 3 years and 
      then drums for 2 years after that.

      It's interesting that I decided to list travel as a major interest of mine. Yes, I have 
      always been excited by it, but at the same time, no, I haven't done it very much. I've 
      travelled all along the East Coast of the US and even a couple trips to the West Coast. 
      I've been to the Bahamas and to Japan. I'm certainly fortunate that I can list just 
      those few. That given, travel remains strongly bolded and italicized on my to-do list.

        My 3rd grade teacher told me to become a writer when I got older. That hasn't happened 
        yet, but I still enjoy losing myself in the works of others. While I still read fiction 
        from time to time, I mostly find myself reading "boring" non-fiction books. Think books 
        like, Creativity Inc. (Pixar's founding), Steve Jobs (how Apple started), or Elon Musk 
        (how spaceships are made). I know, dreadfully boring, right?
