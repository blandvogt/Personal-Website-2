        I attended the prestigious Scholar's Program at Saint Peter's Boys 
        High School on a full academic scholarship in my hometown of Staten 
        Island, New York. While there, I was a member of several 
        volunteer clubs, the student council, and was accepted into the National 
        Honor Society (NHS).

        In my senior year I volunteered to run an after-schoolÂ tutoring program 
        for the NHS. By year end, I expanded the program from a single elementary 
        school, to 8 schools around the borough. I was presented a Community Service award for this 
        undertaking, accompanied by a small scholarship at graduation.

        Like most students at the start of senior year, I had no idea what I wanted to pursue 
        as a career. On a whim, I decided to take a Computer Science elective in C++. By the end of the 
        first class, I remember grinning at the words, "Hello World!", on my screen and 
        knowing that I had found my passion.
