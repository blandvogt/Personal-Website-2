            As a Junior at LIU,Â I noticed the student body's lack of enthusiasm for computer science. 
            In response, I founded the Computer Science Club with the goal of 
            introducing basic engineering concepts through exciting and accessible means. Under my 
            leadership as President, we held workshops on software development, 
            networked with local internship opportunities, and participated in community service 
            among other things. I even led a presentation on the application of VR in academics, 
            which won the club a first place monetary prize in the LIU Student Organization Showcase.
