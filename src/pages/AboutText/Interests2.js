        If you read the many paragraphs above, then you'd know I didn't grow up a programmer. 
        Until my last year of High School I didn't know a thing about computers other than 
        how to play video games on them. I quantify a genuine interest as something I would 
        be doing even if I wasn't paid for it. I'll tell you right now, no one gave me a 
        nickel for building this website.

        I like to say I learned how to cook because I loved eating good food, and that 
        was only possible if I cooked it myself. It started as joke about my Mom's 
        cooking, but in reality, she's actually pretty good. So I guess that means I 
        just enjoy it for what it is. And you guessed it, I keep a private food 
        gallery on my phone of every thing I've ever eaten at every (EVERY) 
        restaurantÂ I've ever been to.

        From a young age, I was raised into a family that profoundly routed for Yankee 
        baseball. When I reached a High School age, I even developed a love for Knicks 
        basketball. If you know anything about the NBA, you'll know that I regret that 
        decision from time to time. I was never athletic enough to participate in any 
        sports in an organized manner (believe me, I tried). Regardless, you can still 
        find me playing ball with friends at the park, or occasionally lounging around 
        that big ballpark in the Bronx.
