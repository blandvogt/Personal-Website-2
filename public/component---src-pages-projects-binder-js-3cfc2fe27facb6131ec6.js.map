Firstly, that textbooks represent \n      a significant portion of a student's educational costs. Secondly, that \n      textbooks have a shelf life of about 3 - 5 years and rarely does information change frequent \n      enough to warrent yearly textbook updates. Binder would allow a user to upload their class \n      schedule and connect with students who had taken those classes previously. Within minutes, \n      a student could either unload their old textbooks, or purchase new ones at\n      significantly cheaper prices than retail.\n    </Typography>\n    <br/>\n    <Typography variant={'body1'}>\n      Binder was awarded 3rd place (Honorable Mention) for the Regional Technology bracket, beating out \n      almost 30 other teams.
