By year end, I expanded the program from a single elementary \n        school, to 8 schools around the borough. I was presented a Community Service award for this \n        undertaking, accompanied by a small scholarship at graduation.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography className='textBody' variant=\"body2\">\n        Like most students at the start of senior year, I had no idea what I wanted to pursue \n        as a career.
