In response, I founded the Computer Science \n        Club with the goal of introducing basic engineering concepts through \n        exciting and accessible means. Under my leadership as President, we \n        held workshops on software development, networked with local internship \n        opportunities, and participated in community service among other things. \n        I even led a presentation on the application of VR in academics, that won \n        the club a first place monetary prize in the LIU Student Organization Showcase.\n    </Typography>\n)\n\nexport default CSClub;"],"sourceRoot":""}
