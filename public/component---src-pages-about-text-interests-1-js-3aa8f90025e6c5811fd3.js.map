Not one of the \n      super famous bands that died at the ages of 40. More like one of those regional bands \n      that he could brag about to his friends, but that would disappear into oblivion after \n      a couple years. Nonetheless, I took professional guitar lessons for about 3 years and \n      then drums for 2 years after that.\n    </Typography>\n\n    <Typography variant=\"subtitle1\"><strong>Travel</strong></Typography>\n    <Typography className='textBody' variant=\"body2\">\n      It's interesting that I decided to list travel as a major interest of mine. Yes, I have \n      always been excited by it, but at the same time, no, I haven't done it very much. I've \n      travelled all along the East Coast of the US and even a couple trips to the West Coast. \n      I've been to the Bahamas and to Japan. I'm certainly fortunate that I can list just \n      those few. That given, travel remains strongly bolded and italicized on my to-do list.\n    </Typography>\n\n    <Typography variant=\"subtitle1\"><strong>Reading</strong></Typography>\n    <Typography className='textBody' variant=\"body2\">\n        My 3rd grade teacher told me to become a writer when I got older. That hasn't happened \n        yet, but I still enjoy losing myself in the works of others. While I still read fiction \n        from time to time, I mostly find myself reading \"boring\" non-fiction books. Think books \n        like, Creativity Inc. (Pixar's founding), Steve Jobs (how Apple started), or Elon Musk \n        (how spaceships are made). I know, dreadfully boring, right?\n    </Typography>\n  </>\n)\n\nexport default Interests1;"],"sourceRoot":""}
