I quantify a genuine interest as something I would \n        be doing even if I wasn't paid for it. I'll tell you right now, no one gave me a \n        nickel for building this website.\n    </Typography>\n\n    <Typography variant=\"subtitle1\"><strong>Culinary Arts</strong></Typography>\n    <Typography className='textBody' variant=\"body2\">\n        I like to say I learned how to cook because I loved eating good food, and that \n        was only possible if I cooked it myself. It started as joke about my Mom's \n        cooking, but in reality, she's actually pretty good. So I guess that means I \n        just enjoy it for what it is. And you guessed it, I keep a private food \n        gallery on my phone of every thing I've ever eaten at every (EVERY) \n        restaurantÂ I've ever been to.\n    </Typography>\n\n    <Typography variant=\"subtitle1\"><strong>Sports</strong></Typography>\n    <Typography className='textBody' variant=\"body2\">\n        From a young age, I was raised into a family that profoundly routed for Yankee \n        baseball. When I reached a High School age, I even developed a love for Knicks \n        basketball. If you know anything about the NBA, you'll know that I regret that \n        decision from time to time. I was never athletic enough to participate in any \n        sports in an organized manner (believe me, I tried). Regardless, you can still \n        find me playing ball with friends at the park, or occasionally lounging around \n        that big ballpark in the Bronx.\n    </Typography>\n  </>\n)\n\nexport default Interests2;"],"sourceRoot":""}
