By registering their modem with our app, users  \n      connected to the Wifi would recieve notifications regarding discounts and other \n      incentives for that specific business. Research and interviews with potential users \n      suggested a massive increase in internet bandwidth and increased traffic for smaller businesses.\n    </Typography>\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default WiMove;"],"sourceRoot":""}
