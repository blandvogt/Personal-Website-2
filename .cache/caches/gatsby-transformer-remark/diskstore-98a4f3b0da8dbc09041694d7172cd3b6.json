If you aren't Agile, you aren't effective.\nYou can ask 100 teams what Agile means and you'll get 99 staunchly defended definitions. That remaining 1 team\nis the one that admits they have no idea what they're doing. I certainly don't claim to have the answer to what form of\nAgile is best. I do however, have experience on one of those 1 in a 100 teams. A team that admitted its\nsystem was broken and was willing to (and had the opportunity to) experiment with solutions. In this blog\npost you'll learn about what we learned, only much quicker and alot less painfully.</p>\n<p>I hinted earlier that the ability to experiment with new ideas and processes isn't always a given.\nParticularly at older companies, processes can become so engrained into daily operations, that\nany alteration would take a department-wide effort. Companies  also\nhave varying degrees of what can be altered. For instance, my team was able to shorten\ncode releases to our Staging environment, but couldn't affect the release schedule to Production.</p>"}
